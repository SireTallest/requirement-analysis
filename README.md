# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, this will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## 💡 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating what a software system must do to meet stakeholder needs. It involves gathering input from clients, users, and business analysts to clearly define both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform, e.g., security, performance, scalability).

 *Importance in SDLC:*

- Acts as the foundation for design, development, and testing.
- Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of project goals.
- Reduces scope creep, rework, and cost overruns.
- Improves software quality by addressing real user needs.

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Clarity of Goals: Ensures all stakeholders agree on what the software should achieve.
- Foundation for Design & Development: Provides a blueprint for building the system correctly.
- Cost & Time Efficiency: Prevents unnecessary rework, scope creep, and delays.
- Quality Assurance: Helps deliver software that meets real user needs and expectations.
- Risk Reduction: Identifies potential challenges early in the SDLC.

*🔑 Three key reasons why requirement analysis is critical in the SDLC*

- Clear Understanding of Needs – It ensures developers and stakeholders share the same vision of what the software should achieve, preventing confusion and misaligned goals.
- Efficient Use of Resources – By identifying requirements early, teams avoid unnecessary rework, saving time, cost, and effort during later stages of development.
- Improved Software Quality – Well-defined requirements guide design, coding, and testing, ensuring the final product meets user expectations and performs reliably.

# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, this will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## üí° What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating what a software system must do to meet stakeholder needs. It involves gathering input from clients, users, and business analysts to clearly define both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform, e.g., security, performance, scalability).

 *Importance in SDLC:*

- Acts as the foundation for design, development, and testing.
- Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of project goals.
- Reduces scope creep, rework, and cost overruns.
- Improves software quality by addressing real user needs.

## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Clarity of Goals: Ensures all stakeholders agree on what the software should achieve.
- Foundation for Design & Development: Provides a blueprint for building the system correctly.
- Cost & Time Efficiency: Prevents unnecessary rework, scope creep, and delays.
- Quality Assurance: Helps deliver software that meets real user needs and expectations.
- Risk Reduction: Identifies potential challenges early in the SDLC.

*üîë Three key reasons why requirement analysis is critical in the SDLC*

- Clear Understanding of Needs ‚Äì It ensures developers and stakeholders share the same vision of what the software should achieve, preventing confusion and misaligned goals.
- Efficient Use of Resources ‚Äì By identifying requirements early, teams avoid unnecessary rework, saving time, cost, and effort during later stages of development.
- Improved Software Quality ‚Äì Well-defined requirements guide design, coding, and testing, ensuring the final product meets user expectations and performs reliably.

## üîë Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Requirement Gathering: Collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders, users, and clients.

- Requirement Elicitation: Using techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops to draw out detailed requirements.

- Requirement Documentation: Recording requirements in clear, structured formats (e.g., SRS ‚Äì Software Requirement Specification).

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often representing them with models or diagrams.

- Requirement Validation: Ensuring documented requirements align with stakeholder needs and are achievable within scope and constraints.

## Types of Requirements

 ### ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements and its examples
|   Definition                      |   Examples, using the case study |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   Functional requirements are      |  Users search and book hotels
  the requirements that describe    |  View details
  what the system should do, like   |  Manage hotel data & inventory
  the core services and features    |  Avoid double booking
   users interact with.             |  Send booking notifications
                                    |
   Non Functional requirements      |  Scalability to millions of users
   define how the system should     |  High availability and fault tolerance
   perform and behave, covering     |  Fast response
   quality, performance, and        |  Strong consistency under concurrency
   reliability.
